- [x] Configure Sanity.io CMS project (schemas, studio config, content structure)
- [x] Set up Firebase project for user data (Firestore, Storage, configuration)
- [x] Implement Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google OAuth, user management)
- [x] Add performance monitoring setup (Firebase Analytics + Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights)
- [x] Configure error monitoring (Sentry for client/server/edge, Firebase Crashlytics)
- [x] Set up testing framework (Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright + accessibility testing)
- [x] Implement WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance foundation (skip links, focus management, screen reader support, aria labels)

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-5) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Data Architecture
- **Content Layer**: Sanity.io for recipes, blog posts, and editorial content
- **User Layer**: Firebase Firestore for user profiles, preferences, and social features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Sanity for content-heavy data, Firebase for user interactions
- **Real-time updates**: Firebase Realtime Database for social features, Sanity webhooks for content
- **Search**: Sanity's built-in search + Firebase full-text search with Algolia integration
