## Data Architecture
- **Content Layer**: Sanity.io for recipes, blog posts, and editorial content
- **User Layer**: Firebase Firestore for user profiles, preferences, and social features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Sanity for content-heavy data, Firebase for user interactions
- **Real-time updates**: Firebase Realtime Database for social features, Sanity webhooks for content
- **Search**: Sanity's built-in search + Firebase full-text search with Algolia integration
- **Cost Optimization**: Firebase's pay-per-use model more suitable for growing user base
