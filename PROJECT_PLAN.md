## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Setup (Week 1-2) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 with App Router
- [x] Configure TypeScript with strict mode (strict: true enabled)
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS with custom design system (umami/sage/cream color palette, mobile-first utilities, CultivateWP-inspired components)
- [x] Install and configure ShadCN/UI components (button, card, input, label, badge, avatar, dialog, dropdown-menu, navigation-menu)
- [x] Configure Sanity.io CMS project (schemas, studio config, content structure)
- [x] Set up Firebase project for user data (Firestore, Storage, configuration)
- [x] Implement Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google OAuth, user management)
- [x] Add performance monitoring setup (Firebase Analytics + Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights)
- [x] Configure error monitoring (Sentry for client/server/edge, Firebase Crashlytics)
- [x] Set up testing framework (Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright + accessibility testing)
- [x] Implement WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance foundation (skip links, focus management, screen reader support, aria labels)

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-5) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Build recipe discovery system with personalized feed

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 6-7) üöß IN PROGRESS
- [x] Add social features (ratings, comments, sharing)
- [ ] Implement real-time cooking sessions with Firebase Realtime Database
- [x] Add ingredient integration with grocery APIs (Instacart, Walmart)
- [ ] Performance optimization and animations

### Phase 4: Polish & Launch (Week 8)
- [ ] Testing and quality assurance
- [ ] SEO optimization
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] Deployment to production

## Data Architecture
- **Content Layer**: Sanity.io for recipes, blog posts, and editorial content
- **User Layer**: Firebase Firestore for user profiles, preferences, and social features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Sanity for content-heavy data, Firebase for user interactions
- **Real-time updates**: Firebase Realtime Database for social features, Sanity webhooks for content
- **Search**: Sanity's built-in search + Firebase full-text search with Algolia integration
- **Cost Optimization**: Firebase's pay-per-use model more suitable for growing user base
